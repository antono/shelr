## Dependencies

### Linux/Hurd

You need `script` tool from linux-utils.
It's already installed if You use Linux.
Note that old school BSD `script` will not work.

### BSD/OSX

Unfortunally BSD and OSX ship old `script` wich lack timing support.
If You use this systems - install `ttyrec` via ports macprots or homebrew
and setup it as recording backend.

     brew install ttyrec      # OSX
     sudo port install ttyrec # BSD / OSX
     shelr backend ttyrec     # BSD / OSX
